## Get Started

Zemit is using the [Phalcon Framework](https://phalconphp.com) which is written in [Zephir/C](https://zephir-lang.com/) with platform independence in mind.
As a result, Phalcon is available on Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS.
You can either download a binary package for the system of your choice or build it from source.

You can use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) `composer require zemit-official/cms-core` in order to add Zemit core to an existing project. If you want to create a new project from srtach, we invite you to visit the [Zemit App](https://github.com/zemit-official/cms) repository for more informations.
    
tldr; `composer create-project zemit-official/cms` will include the core and more tools
